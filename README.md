# Weather Dashboard

This project is a full-stack web application that displays real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city's weather, and the app returns details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Running the Server and Client

Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd server
```
